##  About Me

I build things that scale, break them to learn more, and automate anything I get tired of doing twice.

From debugging race conditions at 2AM to tuning 3D printer firmware by hand, I live at the intersection of software, systems, and curiosity. I donâ€™t just write code â€” I engineer solutions, question assumptions, and obsess over details that actually matter.
