##  About Me

I build things that scale, break them to learn more, and automate anything I get tired of doing twice.

From debugging race conditions at 2AM to tuning 3D printer firmware by hand, I live at the intersection of software, systems, and curiosity. I donâ€™t just write code â€” I engineer solutions, question assumptions, and obsess over details that actually matter.

## Selected Projects

- **Project revgen**: A voice-controlled system designed to help elderly people interact with electronic devices through natural language commands in their native language.
- **SpeakSense**: SpeakSense is a multimodal deep learning project that detects when a user is speaking to a virtual assistant by analyzing both audio and video in real time
- **Scene Sniffer**: A Chrome extension that identifies from which movie or TV series the YouTube Shorts video is from
- **Project AIRA**: A fun little take on building a cheap humanoid robot using a Raspberry Pi and readily available components. Powered by LLMs, it has the ability to answer questions, tell jokes, and even sing songs along with controlling it's robotic arm.
